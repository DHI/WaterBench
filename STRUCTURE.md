# WaterBench Repository Structure

This document defines the canonical structure for a [WaterBench](https://dhi.github.io/WaterBench/) case repository. It is the rubric used by the [`review-waterbench-case`](.github/skills/review-waterbench-case/SKILL.md) agent skill, and the reference for anyone creating or maintaining a WaterBench case.

The spec is **tiered**:

- A **Universal Core** that every WaterBench case must follow.
- An **Addendum** that depends on the case family (model-based, data-only, urban-water, etc.).
- A **Controlled Vocabulary** (MUST) that prevents synonym drift across cases.
- **Conventions** (SHOULD) that describe shared practice but allow case-specific deviation.

Existing cases may not yet conform to the latest version of this spec — when the spec evolves, old cases are not retro-fitted unless a new release is published. The spec is a target for new cases and a checklist for reviews, not a CI gate.

Conformance keywords follow [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119): **MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**.

## 1. Case families

Detect the case family from the repository name and contents. The family determines which addendum applies.

| Family            | Repo name pattern                           | Hallmark                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MIKE21HD          | `WaterBench-MIKE21HD-<Location>`            | 2D hydrodynamic MIKE setup (`.m21fm`, `.mesh`, `.dfs*`)           |
| MIKE3HD           | `WaterBench-MIKE3HD-<Location>`             | 3D hydrodynamic MIKE setup                                        |
| MIKE21SW          | `WaterBench-MIKE21SW-<Location>`            | Spectral wave MIKE setup (`.sw`)                                  |
| MIKESHE           | `WaterBench-MIKESHE-<Location>`             | Integrated hydrology MIKE SHE setup                               |
| MIKEplus          | `WaterBench-MIKEplus-<Location>`            | Urban water MIKE+ setup (`.mupp`, `.sqlite`)                      |
| TimeSeries        | `WaterBench-TimeSeries-<Topic>`             | Pure time-series data case, no physical model                     |
| WD (Water Distr.) | `WaterBench-WD-<Topic>`                     | Water-distribution sensor data, no physical model                 |
| Other             | `WaterBench-<Type>-<Location>`              | New family — must extend this spec before being accepted          |

Families that include a physical model (`MIKE*`, and any future model family) are collectively **model-based**. Families without a physical model (`TimeSeries`, `WD`) are **data-only**.

---

## 2. Universal Core (every case)

Every WaterBench case **MUST** contain, at the repository root:

| Path           | Kind | Notes                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`    | File | Top-level description. See [§5 README conventions](#5-readme-conventions).              |
| `LICENSE`      | File | Plain text. Filename **MUST** be exactly `LICENSE` (uppercase, no extension). See §4.   |
| `code/`        | Dir  | Notebooks and scripts for data exploration and validation.                              |

A case **SHOULD** also contain at the repository root:

| Path             | Kind | Notes                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `requirements.txt` | File | Pinned Python dependencies for the notebooks/scripts in `code/`. Preferred over `pyproject.toml`: cases are script-style data deposits, not installable packages. |

A case **MUST NOT** contain at the repository root:

- Top-level data files (e.g. `*.csv`, `*.parquet`, `*.dfs*`) — these belong inside a domain directory.
- **Committed** zip/archive artifacts *anywhere* (e.g. `zenodo_upload.zip`, `output.zip`). These are build outputs for the Zenodo deposit, produced locally by the scripts in `.publish/` and **gitignored** (`*.zip`); they MUST NOT be committed to the repository.

---

## 3. Addendum by family

### 3.1 Model-based cases (MIKE21HD / MIKE3HD / MIKE21SW / MIKESHE / MIKEplus / future model families)

A model-based case **MUST** additionally contain:

| Path              | Kind | Notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model/`          | Dir  | Model setup files and simulation logs. MIKE SHE cases **MAY** omit this if the model is in `input/`. |
| `input/`          | Dir  | Boundary conditions, forcing, mesh, parameters.                                                    |
| `output_sample/`  | Dir  | Reduced model outputs for testing. See §4 — name is fixed.                                         |
| `observations/`   | Dir  | Observation data (`.dfs0`) + a single `stations.csv` manifest, for model-vs-observation validation. See §8. |
| `figures/`        | Dir  | Plots generated by the notebooks in `code/`.                                                       |
| `.preprocessing/` | Dir  | Notebooks that produced the data under `input/` and `observations/` from raw sources.              |
| `.publish/`       | Dir  | Scripts and metadata for the Zenodo publication workflow.                                          |

`.preprocessing/` is hidden (leading dot) because it is part of the *source* used to *produce* the published data, not part of the published artifact itself. `.publish/` is hidden for the same reason. Both **SHOULD** be excluded from the Zenodo upload.

### 3.2 Data-only cases (TimeSeries / WD / future data-only families)

A data-only case **MUST** additionally contain one of:

| Path             | Kind | Notes                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `observations/`  | Dir  | When the case is observation-centric. Same name as the model-based equivalent.       |
| `data/`          | Dir  | When the case is generic data (e.g. sensor logs not tied to a specific phenomenon).  |

A data-only case **SHOULD** additionally contain:

| Path             | Kind | Notes                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `processed/`     | Dir  | Cleaned / derived data products built from raw inputs.                               |
| `figures/`       | Dir  | Plots generated by the notebooks in `code/`.                                         |
| `.publish/`      | Dir  | Scripts and metadata for the Zenodo publication workflow.                            |

---

## 4. Controlled vocabulary (MUST)

To prevent synonym drift between cases authored by different people, the following names are **canonical**. They **MUST** be used when the concept applies; the listed synonyms **MUST NOT** be used at the top level of a WaterBench repository.

### 4.1 Top-level directories

| Canonical name     | Forbidden synonyms                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code/`            | `notebooks/`, `scripts/`, `src/`, `analysis/`            |
| `observations/`    | `measurements/`, `obs/`, `gauges/`, `sensors/`           |
| `data/`            | `dataset/`, `inputs/` (when the case is data-only)       |
| `model/`           | `setup/`, `simulation/`                                  |
| `input/`           | `inputs/`, `forcing/`, `bc/`                             |
| `output_sample/`   | `sample_output/`, `outputs/`, `results/`, `data_sample/` |
| `processed/`       | `derived/`, `prepared/`, `intermediate/`                 |
| `figures/`         | `plots/`, `images/`, `img/`                              |
| `.preprocessing/`  | `preprocess/`, `raw/`, `prep/`                           |
| `.publish/`        | `publish/`, `zenodo/`, `release/`                        |

### 4.2 Required filenames

| Canonical name        | Forbidden variants                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`           | `Readme.md`, `readme.md`, `README.MD`             |
| `LICENSE`             | `license.txt`, `License`, `LICENSE.md`, `COPYING` |

`LICENSE` is the historical drift point — several cases use `license.txt`. New cases **MUST** use `LICENSE`; existing cases **SHOULD** be migrated when next published.

### 4.3 Glossary (advisory, applies anywhere)

When the following concepts are referenced in READMEs, notebook filenames, column names, or subdirectory names, the canonical term **SHOULD** be used. The skill flags deviations as advisories rather than errors.

| Concept                              | Canonical                  | Synonyms to avoid                       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Observed data used for validation    | observation(s)             | measurement(s), gauge data              |
| Comparison of model to observations  | validation                 | verification                            |
| Adjusting parameters to fit data     | calibration                | tuning, fitting                         |
| The unstructured grid                | mesh                       | grid (when MIKE-flexible-mesh is meant) |
| Atmospheric/oceanic input            | forcing                    | drivers, inputs (in this context only)  |
| Lateral driving condition            | boundary condition         | open boundary, BC (in prose)            |
| Reduced sample of model output       | output sample              | sample output, sample data              |
| Notebook for exploring observations  | `explore_observation_data` | `explore_obs`, `analyze_measurements`   |
| Notebook for exploring model results | `explore_model_result_data`| `explore_model`, `analyze_results`      |
| Notebook for validation              | `model_validation_<variable>`| `validate_<variable>`, `compare_*`    |

## 5. README conventions (SHOULD)

The repository `README.md` **SHOULD** contain, in order, the following top-level sections. Section names **SHOULD** match exactly (case-sensitive).

1. **Title** — `# WaterBench Case: <Human readable name>`
2. **Disclaimer** — short paragraph stating that the data is for educational/research use, not operational.
3. **Intended Use** — bullet list of supported use cases.
4. **Folder Structure** — an indented list mirroring §2 + §3 for the relevant family.
5. **Model description** — one of: `MIKE 21 Flow Model FM`, `MIKE 21 Spectral Wave Model`, `MIKE SHE Integrated Hydrological Model`, `MIKE+`, or a custom heading for non-model cases (`Data Description`, `Workflow`).
6. **Case Description** — geographic location, system type, extent, hydrodynamic or hydrological characteristics.
7. **Model Setup** (or **Workflow** for non-model cases) — domain, mesh/grid, forcing, parameters, outputs.
8. **Validation** — observation coverage, validation approach, skill metrics. Reference validation notebooks under `code/model_validation_*.ipynb`.
9. **Data Sources** — table of source, citation, license per data set used.

The [`WaterBench-template`](https://github.com/DHI/WaterBench-template) repository provides a fillable scaffold for this README.

### 5.1 Sub-directory READMEs (SHOULD)

Each of `code/`, `input/`, `model/`, `observations/`, `output_sample/`, `figures/`, `.preprocessing/`, `.publish/` **SHOULD** contain a one-paragraph `README.md` describing what is inside. The template repo demonstrates this pattern.

---

## 6. Publishing workflow (SHOULD)

A model-based case **SHOULD** include in `.publish/`:

- `zip_repo.py` — bundles the repository (minus large output) for Zenodo.
- `zip_output.py` — bundles full output data for Zenodo (when output data exceeds what fits in `output_sample/`).
- `zenodo_text.md` — text used in the Zenodo deposit description.
- `README.pdf` — rendered version of the top-level README, produced by the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/`.

The repository **SHOULD** carry a GitHub Actions workflow that renders `README.md` to `README.pdf` and commits it to `.publish/`. See the template for the reference workflow.

---

## 7. Model setup runnability (MUST, model-based cases)

A WaterBench case is meant to be **runnable without modifications** after cloning. The model setup file (`.m21fm`, `.sw`, `.she`, `.mupp`, etc.) **MUST** be committed to the repository — it is the entry point the case is run from, so a case whose setup file is missing, gitignored, or stored only externally is non-compliant. The setup file **MUST** reference all input data using **relative paths** that resolve from the model file's directory.

### 7.1 Path requirements

In the model setup file(s):

- Every referenced file (mesh, boundary conditions, forcing, parameter files) **MUST** exist in the repository at the referenced path, resolved relative to the model file's location.
- Absolute paths (e.g. `C:\Projects\Hamburg\input\mesh.mesh`, `/mnt/d/...`, `\\server\share\...`) **MUST NOT** appear. Such paths are residue from the author's local environment and break reproducibility for everyone else.
- Path separators **SHOULD** use `\` *or* `/` consistently per file family — MIKE setup files traditionally use `\`. The skill does not flag separator choice; only existence.
- Forward references **MUST** resolve to a file under one of `input/`, `model/`, or the model directory itself. References that escape the repository root (e.g. `..\..\external\data`) are not allowed.

### 7.2 What the skill checks

The skill extracts path-like tokens (any token containing a file extension known to MIKE: `.mesh`, `.dfs0`, `.dfs1`, `.dfs2`, `.dfs3`, `.dfsu`, `.shp`, `.xns11`, etc.) from the model setup file. For each token:

- If the token is an absolute path → **MUST** finding.
- If the token does not resolve to a file in the repository → **MUST** finding.
- If the token resolves but contains backslashes on a Unix-only repo, or vice versa → **SHOULD** finding (cosmetic).

For binary or opaque setup files (e.g. `.mupp` SQLite-backed), the skill **MAY** skip path extraction and report the limitation as a **NOTE**.

### 7.3 Author guidance

When saving a MIKE setup from a working directory tree like:

```
case/
  model/Case.m21fm
  input/mesh.mesh
```

ensure the setup is saved with the working directory at `case/` so that `Case.m21fm` references `..\input\mesh.mesh` (relative), not `C:\Users\name\case\input\mesh.mesh` (absolute). The MIKE editor offers a "store paths relative to setup" option — use it.

---

## 8. Observation data and station manifest (MUST, model-based cases)

Observations exist to be compared against model output. The contract below makes a case **machine-loadable without per-case code** and **self-describing without guessing** — the two properties that make WaterBench a benchmark rather than a folder of files. (Data-only observation-centric cases **SHOULD** follow §8.1 and §8.3 where they ship an `observations/` directory.)

### 8.1 Format — `.dfs0`, not `.csv`

Observation **time series MUST be stored as `.dfs0`**. A `.dfs0` carries the EUM **item type** and **unit** intrinsically, so the variable and its unit are self-describing and cannot be lost. `.csv` (and any other format that drops item type / unit) **MUST NOT** be used for observation data.

Rationale:

- **Directly usable for data assimilation.** MIKE FM's Data Assimilation module accepts **only `.dfs0`** as observation input. Since data assimilation is a primary WaterBench use case, `.csv` observations could not be fed to it without a conversion step — `.dfs0` is the format that makes the case usable out of the box.
- **No new dependency.** Consuming any model-based case already requires `mikeio` to read the `.dfsu`/`.dfs0` model output, so `.dfs0` adds nothing — and unlike `.csv` it does not throw the units away.
- **No reason to lower the bar.** WaterBench cases are authored by DHI, so there is no foreign-data problem that would justify the lowest-common-denominator `.csv`. (`modelskill` accepts `.csv` only because it must ingest arbitrary users' data; that convenience does not apply to data we control.)

### 8.2 Layout — one `.dfs0` per station

- One `.dfs0` **per station**, named `<station_id>.dfs0`. The filename stem **is** the `station_id` and is the join key to the manifest (§8.3).
- Each station's variables are the **items** inside its `.dfs0`, tagged with EUM item type + unit. A tide gauge holds `[Water Level]`; an ecosystem station holds `[Dissolved oxygen, Temperature, Salinity, …]`. The variable lives in the data, **never** in the filename.
- Altimetry tracks are named `Altimetry_<mission>.dfs0` (e.g. `Altimetry_3a.dfs0`); the variable is the EUM item, not part of the name.

### 8.3 Station manifest — `stations.csv` (variable-agnostic)

A single `stations.csv` is the **only** permitted `.csv` under `observations/`. It is tabular metadata, not a time series (a `.dfs0` has no native slot for coordinates/CRS). It **MUST** contain one row per station with at least:

| Column           | Notes                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `station_id`     | **MUST** match the `.dfs0` filename stem exactly. The join key.                           |
| `x` / `lon`      | Coordinate, consistent with the declared `crs`.                                           |
| `y` / `lat`      | Coordinate, consistent with the declared `crs`.                                           |
| `crs`            | EPSG code (e.g. `EPSG:4326`). **MUST** be declared — no implicit WGS84.                    |
| `vertical_datum` | Required for any station carrying water level (e.g. `MSL`, `DVR90`, chart datum). EUM gives "metre", never "metre relative to *what*". |

The manifest **MUST NOT encode variable** — not by splitting into per-variable files (`current_stations.csv`, `stations_swh.csv`), and not by an implicit "default variable" convention (`stations.csv` = water level by assumption). Variable coverage is discovered by reading each station's `.dfs0` items. This is the only layout that generalises to families with no dominant variable (e.g. ecosystem models, where a station carries oxygen, nutrients, salinity and temperature with no privileged "main" variable).

### 8.4 Vocabulary — EUM canonical, CF an optional mirror

- The canonical variable + unit vocabulary is **EUM** (item type + unit), carried natively by `.dfs0` and identical to what the model output is tagged with — so the model-vs-observation comparison is a direct join, not a translation step.
- A **CF standard name** mirror **SHOULD** be provided (e.g. as a manifest column) for cross-domain interoperability, on a best-effort basis. It is advisory, never the join key: CF coverage is patchy for some biogeochemical quantities, which is precisely why EUM is canonical and CF is the mirror.

### 8.5 Referential integrity (MUST, bidirectional)

- Every `station_id` in `stations.csv` **MUST** have a corresponding `.dfs0`.
- Every observation `.dfs0` **MUST** map to a `station_id` row in `stations.csv`.

No orphan rows (a station with no data) and no orphan files (data with no metadata). This is the cheapest, highest-value check in the spec: a "remove bad stations" cleanup that deletes the data but leaves the manifest row is otherwise invisible to a human skimming the directory listing.

---

## 9. Anti-patterns (MUST NOT)

- **Synonym directories at the top level**: see §4.1.
- **Mixed-case license filename**: see §4.2.
- **Top-level data sprawl**: data files at the repo root that should live under a domain directory.
- **`output/` at the top of a published case** that duplicates `output_sample/`: keep full outputs on Zenodo, only sample data in the repo. The template carries an empty `output/` for clarity, but published cases **MUST NOT** ship large output files in the repository.
- **Committed zip/archive**: a `*.zip` committed *anywhere* in the repo. Archives are gitignored build outputs for the Zenodo deposit; `.publish/` holds the *scripts* that generate them (`zip_repo.py`, `zip_output.py`), never the archives themselves.
- **`.csv` observation data**: observation time series in `.csv` (or any non-`.dfs0` format). Only `stations.csv` may be `.csv` — see §8.1.
- **Variable-encoded station manifest**: `current_stations.csv`, `stations_<variable>.csv`, or an implicit "default variable" convention — see §8.3.
- **Orphan station or orphan data file**: a `stations.csv` row with no `.dfs0`, or a `.dfs0` with no manifest row — see §8.5.
- **Undeclared CRS**: station coordinates without an explicit `crs`. WGS84 is a good guess, but a benchmark must not force consumers to guess — see §8.3.

## 10. How conformance is checked

The skill at [`.github/skills/review-waterbench-case/`](.github/skills/review-waterbench-case/SKILL.md) reads this spec and produces a markdown findings report against a target WaterBench repository. It is invoked from the agent CLI (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, or any compatible agent that supports `.github/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`) with:

```
/review-waterbench-case <path-to-cloned-case>
```

The skill is **read-only**: it produces a report. It does not open issues, push branches, or rename files. Findings are graded:

- **MUST** — a violation of the controlled vocabulary or a missing core/addendum item.
- **SHOULD** — a deviation from convention. Worth fixing on the next release; not blocking.
- **NOTE** — an observation worth flagging to a human reviewer.

---

## 11. Evolving this spec

The spec evolves. When it does:

1. Update this document.
2. Update the skill body if new MUST checks have been added.
3. Note in the changelog (below) which existing cases now fall behind.
4. Existing cases are **not** retro-fitted automatically. They catch up the next time they are published.

### Changelog

- **2026-05-28** — initial version. Directory layout (§2–§3), controlled vocabulary (§4), README conventions (§5), and runnability (§7) derived from a survey of `WaterBench-template`, `MIKE21HD-Oresund`, `MIKE3HD-Oresund`, `MIKE21HD-HamburgElbeEstuary`, `MIKE21HD-ConceptionBay`, `MIKE21HD-SouthernNorthSea`, `MIKE21SW-SouthernNorthSea`, `MIKESHE-Skjern`, `MIKEplus-Bellinge`, `TimeSeries-WWTPINflow`, and `WD-SensorData`.

  The observation contract (§8) is **prescriptive, not descriptive**: observation data **MUST** be `.dfs0` (the only format MIKE FM Data Assimilation accepts, and self-describing via EUM), organised one `.dfs0` per station, with a single variable-agnostic `stations.csv` manifest declaring explicit `crs` and (for water level) `vertical_datum`, EUM as the canonical vocabulary, and bidirectional referential integrity. Most surveyed cases predate this: they use `.csv` observations, per-variable manifests (`current_stations.csv`, `stations_<var>.csv`), or omit `crs`/`vertical_datum`, and so do **not** yet conform. Per §11.4 they catch up on next publish.
